# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Revenue Predictor & Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

This project explores movie data to analyze revenue trends and predict box office performance using various features such as genre, budget, runtime, and more. The project also includes data visualizations to understand historical revenue patterns and genre-based insights.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical movie data to uncover revenue trends.
- Compare revenue over the years by genre.
- Build a machine learning model to predict movie revenue.
- Visualize key patterns using Power BI for stakeholder presentation.
